19,"Travis Head | Player of the Match - 137(120): Never expected this, not in a million years, truly an exceptional day. Lot better than sitting on the couch at home. Really glad to contribute, the first twenty balls I played gave me a lot of confidence and yea I was able to carry through. The way Mitch Marsh came out and took the game on, he set the tone. That was the energy we wanted and we knew the wicket may get tough. It was a great decision to bowl first after winning the toss. I felt the wicket got better as the day went on. It took a little bit of spin, it paid dividends. Nice to be a part of it, nice to play a role in all of that. He’s (Rohit Sharma) probably the unluckiest man in the world. Again, it's (fielding) something that I worked hard on. I couldn't imagine getting a hundred, couldn't probably imagine holding onto that one. Was great to hold on to that catch. Important to look after your team-mates, to be able to do that on the big stage in front of a full house is a nice thing. (On joining the list of centurions in WC finals - Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and Head) Definitely third on that list, it's a nice one to join, nice to be here and nice to contribute. I'll just tell the boys that I'm looking forward to the reunion.","[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9995304346084595}]"
20,"Adam Zampa: Interesting to see the strategy today. Winning the toss and bowling, we knew it would spin and it would be difficult to score runs. The Cummins spell was a bit of a gamechanger, and the bowling innings was pretty much unbelievable today. We knew the wicket was getting better to bat and that’s when we started getting more confident.","[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.8741998672485352}]"
21,"Mitchell Starc: He (Cummins) was phenomenal, he's been phenomenal all tournament in his decision making, his leadership. At times, he had to step up with the ball when it's been a bit flat. Capped off an unbelievable eight weeks for this group. I haven't got any words left. Between Pat, Ron (Andrew McDonald) and all our coaching staff, all our players across formats, it's been an incredible winter. I don't think you could write a script to top the win that we've had. To win a World Cup in India, it's been a fantastic eight weeks . Bloody successful and bloody enjoyable.","[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9991222023963928}]"
22,"Steve Smith: Incredible feeling! Atmosphere was amazing today. Great performance from the team. The bowlers set the tone, fielding was great. Travis Head - the show he put on was incredible. Took the game on and Marnus played another unbelievable knock and played a great supporting role. Wasn't the ideal start for us (with bat) but we had the belief and we have got a good group of players. We had a poor start and then had to get into the top four - Australia typically plays well in those moments. It has been a pretty big year for us winning the Test championship and this. Yeah, it was pretty good fun.","[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998260140419006}]"
23,"Mitch Marsh: Pure elation right now. Been the hardest 8 weeks of cricket I was a part of. To be here with this group, it feels unbelievable.","[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9931356906890869}]"
24,"Josh Hazlewood: This is bigger (than 2015). We won at home in front of our home fans but the challenges that we've been through in the last couple of months, coming here, playing in these conditions against India which is a pretty special team. To win on a day like this is amazing. Such a great crowd, Indian fans are second to none, a few started to leave towards the end, amazing crowd. That's just the belief in the squad. Just got on a run and tonight it's the perfect game, we put it together when it counted.","[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9998418092727661}]"
25,"Glenn Maxwell: (On winning shot) Bit of a slog but it feels amazing, we were all excited when it got back down to 20 runs. I resigned myself to the fact that I wouldn’t have to bat like 2015, but obviously Heady got out and I had to go out there and finish the job. It is a bit different when you see Head take on Bumrah, I got a taste of my own medicine. Head was phenomenal and Marnus was second to none. It was an unbelievable partnership.","[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9989606142044067}]"
26,"David Warner: Our bowlers were fantastic, they set the tone from ball one. The fielding supported that. To bowl India out for 240 in a final is absolutely exceptional. There was a bit of nervous energy in the change room. We kept changing places. But that was a brilliant partnership between Marnus (Labuschagne) and Trav (Head). What a comeback that was from Head, especially after coming back from injury, that was fantastic.","[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9997854828834534}]"
27,"Marnus Labuschagne: Oh mate! What we've achieved today is unbelievable, the best achievement I have been part of. To come to India. They were 10 from 10 with one to play with. They (India) have been unbelievable. Our bowlers have been sensational and Travis put on a hell of a show. I know I am a man of faith and believe in God. How things have panned out for me, unbelievable. I am lost for words. Very thankful to the coaches for sticking with me. To play 19 games straight from South Africa. big thanks to God for that.","[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9984776377677917}]"
28,"As is the case, lots of winning players being interviewed. We will have every one of them here. Starting with Marnus.","[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9992325305938721}]"
29,"21:40 local, 16:10 GMT, 21:40 IST: Three boundaries in the first over. A chance missed first ball. Warner edging the widest of wide balls against Shami's first legal ball of the second over. Marsh nicking Bumrah's hit-me ball to the keeper and Smith deciding against a review a couple of overs later. 47/3 at the end of 7 overs and every Indian supporter got excited, for obvious reasons of course, given the form of Shami and Bumrah. Travis Head was happy to wade through that difficult phase and once he found an able ally in Labuschagne, there was no looking back. The duo kept the scoreboard ticking with plenty of singles and engineered a match-winning partnership to put their team on the brink of a victory with a 192-run stand. While Head's confidence grew with each passing over, Marnus was content to play second fiddle and blunt out a couple of dangerous spells from the Indian seamers. Travis Head started the spark with a brilliant catch to dismiss Rohit Sharma in the first innings and he carried that unassailable spirit with the bat to compose one of the best knocks in a World Cup final you'd ever see. Marnus might have played the silent killer role today, but anyone who'd followed the Australian campaign thoroughly would confess that Marnus perhaps deserves to be the team's Player of the Series for his crucial contributions at various stages over the past couple of months. Set the standards with the field, dried out the boundaries, removed set batters at vital junctures and didn't panic despite losing their top three inside 7 overs. That is brand Australia for you. Giving up is just not an option for them.","[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9961227774620056}]"
30,"21:31 local, 16:01 GMT, 21:31 IST: Write off Australia at your own peril. You pack them in a casket and bury them in the depths of despair, they would still find a way to spring up towards the skies, akin to a seed sprouting out of soil. Lost their first couple of games and looked in a state of cluelessness at various stages of this World Cup. But come the final, they managed to compile all those pieces together to complete a comprehensive win against India. By doing that, they have also broken the trend of the home team winning the World Cup. India started in 2011 and the team from Down Under put that record to bed tonight.","[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9340295195579529}]"
31,"The winning moment: As soon as Maxwell completed one-and-a-half runs, he was roaring in joy and out came the Aussies running on to the field to hug and celebrate. KL Rahul is on his haunches while Siraj is in tears. KL and others try to console Siraj. Then the customary handshakes follow as the fireworks light up over the Narendra Modi Stadium. After the handshakes are done, the Indians head back inside with Bumrah spotted waving to the Indian fans who clap in appreciation. Also one saw Kohli cover his face with a cap, while Rohit walked back inside head bowed down.

Sixth title in the last 10 editions of the ODI World Cup. Australia, the mighty mighty Australia. CHAMPIONS 2023 Australia. Inglis wins the running race as the rest of his mates join him in hugging the onfield batting pair of Maxwell and Labuschagne. KL Rahul is on his knees, he does not want to leave the field. Virat Kohli looks like a man in shock. Siraj is in tears. Bumrah tries to console him. Rohit Sharma is busy congratulating Australia and displaying true sportmanship while at it. Rahul Dravid now walks out to greet the Aussies. Aaron Finch, the former skipper, is out in the centre and one can spot great amount of joy among the group. A couple of the Australian players are still soaking it up whilst letting out tears of tenacity and hope. The celebrations, as you might have guessed, are not gonna end anytime soon. The night is still young and it's gonna stay that away for the best part of the next few hours for every Australian supporter across the world. Invincible. Incredible. Indomitable. Unyielding. Bloody-minded. You can try and try - to find the apt words to describe the brilliance of Australia, the sporting nation and bet, you'd still fall short of adjectives to detail the wonders the country continues to churn in the field of sport.
