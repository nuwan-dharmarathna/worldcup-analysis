19,"Travis Head | Player of the Match - 137(120): Never expected this, not in a million years, truly an exceptional day. Lot better than sitting on the couch at home. Really glad to contribute, the first twenty balls I played gave me a lot of confidence and yea I was able to carry through. The way Mitch Marsh came out and took the game on, he set the tone. That was the energy we wanted and we knew the wicket may get tough. It was a great decision to bowl first after winning the toss. I felt the wicket got better as the day went on. It took a little bit of spin, it paid dividends. Nice to be a part of it, nice to play a role in all of that. He’s (Rohit Sharma) probably the unluckiest man in the world. Again, it's (fielding) something that I worked hard on. I couldn't imagine getting a hundred, couldn't probably imagine holding onto that one. Was great to hold on to that catch. Important to look after your team-mates, to be able to do that on the big stage in front of a full house is a nice thing. (On joining the list of centurions in WC finals - Ricky Ponting, Adam Gilchrist and Head) Definitely third on that list, it's a nice one to join, nice to be here and nice to contribute. I'll just tell the boys that I'm looking forward to the reunion."
20,"Adam Zampa: Interesting to see the strategy today. Winning the toss and bowling, we knew it would spin and it would be difficult to score runs. The Cummins spell was a bit of a gamechanger, and the bowling innings was pretty much unbelievable today. We knew the wicket was getting better to bat and that’s when we started getting more confident."
21,"Mitchell Starc: He (Cummins) was phenomenal, he's been phenomenal all tournament in his decision making, his leadership. At times, he had to step up with the ball when it's been a bit flat. Capped off an unbelievable eight weeks for this group. I haven't got any words left. Between Pat, Ron (Andrew McDonald) and all our coaching staff, all our players across formats, it's been an incredible winter. I don't think you could write a script to top the win that we've had. To win a World Cup in India, it's been a fantastic eight weeks . Bloody successful and bloody enjoyable."
22,"Steve Smith: Incredible feeling! Atmosphere was amazing today. Great performance from the team. The bowlers set the tone, fielding was great. Travis Head - the show he put on was incredible. Took the game on and Marnus played another unbelievable knock and played a great supporting role. Wasn't the ideal start for us (with bat) but we had the belief and we have got a good group of players. We had a poor start and then had to get into the top four - Australia typically plays well in those moments. It has been a pretty big year for us winning the Test championship and this. Yeah, it was pretty good fun."
23,"Mitch Marsh: Pure elation right now. Been the hardest 8 weeks of cricket I was a part of. To be here with this group, it feels unbelievable."
24,"Josh Hazlewood: This is bigger (than 2015). We won at home in front of our home fans but the challenges that we've been through in the last couple of months, coming here, playing in these conditions against India which is a pretty special team. To win on a day like this is amazing. Such a great crowd, Indian fans are second to none, a few started to leave towards the end, amazing crowd. That's just the belief in the squad. Just got on a run and tonight it's the perfect game, we put it together when it counted."
25,"Glenn Maxwell: (On winning shot) Bit of a slog but it feels amazing, we were all excited when it got back down to 20 runs. I resigned myself to the fact that I wouldn’t have to bat like 2015, but obviously Heady got out and I had to go out there and finish the job. It is a bit different when you see Head take on Bumrah, I got a taste of my own medicine. Head was phenomenal and Marnus was second to none. It was an unbelievable partnership."
26,"David Warner: Our bowlers were fantastic, they set the tone from ball one. The fielding supported that. To bowl India out for 240 in a final is absolutely exceptional. There was a bit of nervous energy in the change room. We kept changing places. But that was a brilliant partnership between Marnus (Labuschagne) and Trav (Head). What a comeback that was from Head, especially after coming back from injury, that was fantastic."
27,"Marnus Labuschagne: Oh mate! What we've achieved today is unbelievable, the best achievement I have been part of. To come to India. They were 10 from 10 with one to play with. They (India) have been unbelievable. Our bowlers have been sensational and Travis put on a hell of a show. I know I am a man of faith and believe in God. How things have panned out for me, unbelievable. I am lost for words. Very thankful to the coaches for sticking with me. To play 19 games straight from South Africa. big thanks to God for that."
28,"As is the case, lots of winning players being interviewed. We will have every one of them here. Starting with Marnus."
29,"21:40 local, 16:10 GMT, 21:40 IST: Three boundaries in the first over. A chance missed first ball. Warner edging the widest of wide balls against Shami's first legal ball of the second over. Marsh nicking Bumrah's hit-me ball to the keeper and Smith deciding against a review a couple of overs later. 47/3 at the end of 7 overs and every Indian supporter got excited, for obvious reasons of course, given the form of Shami and Bumrah. Travis Head was happy to wade through that difficult phase and once he found an able ally in Labuschagne, there was no looking back. The duo kept the scoreboard ticking with plenty of singles and engineered a match-winning partnership to put their team on the brink of a victory with a 192-run stand. While Head's confidence grew with each passing over, Marnus was content to play second fiddle and blunt out a couple of dangerous spells from the Indian seamers. Travis Head started the spark with a brilliant catch to dismiss Rohit Sharma in the first innings and he carried that unassailable spirit with the bat to compose one of the best knocks in a World Cup final you'd ever see. Marnus might have played the silent killer role today, but anyone who'd followed the Australian campaign thoroughly would confess that Marnus perhaps deserves to be the team's Player of the Series for his crucial contributions at various stages over the past couple of months. Set the standards with the field, dried out the boundaries, removed set batters at vital junctures and didn't panic despite losing their top three inside 7 overs. That is brand Australia for you. Giving up is just not an option for them."
30,"21:31 local, 16:01 GMT, 21:31 IST: Write off Australia at your own peril. You pack them in a casket and bury them in the depths of despair, they would still find a way to spring up towards the skies, akin to a seed sprouting out of soil. Lost their first couple of games and looked in a state of cluelessness at various stages of this World Cup. But come the final, they managed to compile all those pieces together to complete a comprehensive win against India. By doing that, they have also broken the trend of the home team winning the World Cup. India started in 2011 and the team from Down Under put that record to bed tonight."
31,"The winning moment: As soon as Maxwell completed one-and-a-half runs, he was roaring in joy and out came the Aussies running on to the field to hug and celebrate. KL Rahul is on his haunches while Siraj is in tears. KL and others try to console Siraj. Then the customary handshakes follow as the fireworks light up over the Narendra Modi Stadium. After the handshakes are done, the Indians head back inside with Bumrah spotted waving to the Indian fans who clap in appreciation. Also one saw Kohli cover his face with a cap, while Rohit walked back inside head bowed down.

The eagle-eyed Deepu Narayanan - our statsman, with this: Maxwell hit the winning run in 2021 T20 WC finals vs NZ in Dubai."
33,"Siraj to Maxwell, 2 runs, thrashed away to the right of deep square, Kuldeep fumbles and tumbles, but it is Australia that have risen tall from the Ashes. Sixth title in the last 10 editions of the ODI World Cup. Australia, the mighty mighty Australia. CHAMPIONS 2023 Australia. Inglis wins the running race as the rest of his mates join him in hugging the onfield batting pair of Maxwell and Labuschagne. KL Rahul is on his knees, he does not want to leave the field. Virat Kohli looks like a man in shock. Siraj is in tears. Bumrah tries to console him. Rohit Sharma is busy congratulating Australia and displaying true sportmanship while at it. Rahul Dravid now walks out to greet the Aussies. Aaron Finch, the former skipper, is out in the centre and one can spot great amount of joy among the group. A couple of the Australian players are still soaking it up whilst letting out tears of tenacity and hope. The celebrations, as you might have guessed, are not gonna end anytime soon. The night is still young and it's gonna stay that away for the best part of the next few hours for every Australian supporter across the world. Invincible. Incredible. Indomitable. Unyielding. Bloody-minded. You can try and try - to find the apt words to describe the brilliance of Australia, the sporting nation and bet, you'd still fall short of adjectives to detail the wonders the country continues to churn in the field of sport. Gee, let that all sink in for a moment..."

Rohit walks up to Head and congratulates him. Ladies and gents, stand up and applaud - does not matter which part of the globe you belong. We have just witnessed one of the best knocks in a World Cup final. It was short and Head sensed an opportunity to smash that for a maximum, hit the pull shot flat and found Shubman Gill to his right at deep mid-wicket.

Bumrah bowled that from wide of the crease and with the angle and the impact on leg-stump it is but umpire Richard Kettleborough does not give it out and it stays as ump's call. ""By millimetres does fate of major events hang!"" is the quip from Harsha Bhogle on air. The attempted inswinging yorker and Labuschagne survives on ump's call as that was just clipping leg-stump. He shuffled across and missed the flick. Again the rub of the green going Australia's way"
169,India review for LBW. Bumrah is convinced and Rohit goes for it. Was it sliding down leg? Bumrah doesn't think so. Labuschagne missed the flick on the shuffle. Joel Wilson the third ump and he looks zoned in tonight too. No bat as UltraEdge shows. Tense faces everywhere. Not out.

186,"Shami to Labuschagne, 1 run, a false shot and it falls well short of fine-leg. Short outside off, Labuschagne makes a late call to play, half-leaves it too and the top-edge lands well short of Bumrah"

188,"Rohit claps and eggs on Shami. Most of the crowd are silent, a few making noise and keeping their enthusiasm going."
189,"The way Travis Head is timing the ball right now, it feels like he is playing on a surface that is only meant to hit the middle of the bat and nothing else. Surely not a great sign if you are an Indian supporter I'm afraid."
190,"Shami to Labuschagne, no run, short of length outside off, turned to mid-wicket"
191,"Shami to Labuschagne, no run, fullish on off, Labuschagne drives to cover, the bat turned there on impact and it was off the thick outer half"

194,"Jadeja to Labuschagne, 1 run, so easy for Australia. No threat from Jadeja at all. Sliding on nicely and they are happy to knock it around. Fullish outside off, driven to sweeper cover"

196,"Jadeja to Labuschagne, 1 run, good length on off, Labuschagne punches wide of cover"
197,"Jadeja to Head, 1 run, tossed up outside off, Head goes for a big loft, gets it off the thick inside half to long-on. After reaching the other end, makes a gesture that he was looking to hit that over extra-cover"
198,"Jadeja to Head, no run, good length and no turn on the stumps, tucked to mid-wicket"
199,Still no slip.
200,"Jadeja to Head, FOUR, Head is in a mood now to turn the screws. But this is an outside-edge. Is beaten by the turn and bounce on this, Head went back to cut and the outside-edge flies away past the vacant slip"
201,Right after Travis Head punched a length delivery to Kohli at cover (23.2) there was a visible amount of frustration from the Indian legend. Kohli hurled a shadow throw initially and then eventually threw the ball fiercely at the non-striker's end. Labuschagne wasn't backing up too far and would have been comfortably home even if he had scored a direct hit.
203,"Shami to Labuschagne, no run, wide of the crease and good length on off-stump, solid back foot block from Labuschagne"
204,"Shami to Labuschagne, no run, good length and shaping back in to the front pad, Labuschagne defends nicely to mid-wicket"
205,"Shami to Head, 1 run, dug in short outside off, Head drags the pull off the cue-end to the short mid-wicket area. He was early into the shot and he looks at his bat after reaching the other end"
206,"Shami to Head, no run, ooh! Head adjusts well, was fullish and stops on Head who was looking to get forward for another big drive, steers it to backward point in the end"
207,"Shami to Head, no run, short of length and angling into Head, tucks him up, defended to cover"
208,"Shami to Head, FOUR, Shami is back and is greeted with a boundary. This is getting increasingly worrying for India now. From round the wicket and it's a half-volley just outside off, Head gets forward and lofts straight down the ground. A statement shot if ever there was one. A fan wearing India's blue can't bear to watch"
209,Mohammed Shami [5.0-1-33-1] is back into the attack
211,"Jadeja to Head, 1 run, Head gives the charge and strokes the drive to long-on"
212,"Jadeja to Head, no run, no turn, good length on the stumps, punched to cover"

220,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, 1 run, again too full, Labuschagne gets forward and strokes it to long-on"
221,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, no run, well tossed up outside off, Labuschagne gets forward and stays leg-side of the ball, drives and the inside-edge hits the boot and rolls away to the off-side"
223,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, FOUR, no slip and four. Slides on as the legbreak goes across Labuschagne who goes on the back foot to cut and the thick outside-edge runs away past the vacant slip"
224,"Kuldeep Yadav to Head, 1 run, no turn on this good length delivery on off, punched to sweeper cover and 50 for Head. Maxwell who is next in, claps in encouragment and eggs him on"
225,"This is the real test for Rohit as captain. Ball isn't doing much, there's an ominous partnership brewing and the opposition is growing confident with every passing moment. What can he do to stop it? Even with a 130,000 cheering for them, how can he stop a lull from descending on the team?"
226,"Kuldeep Yadav to Head, no run, slides on from a good length on the stumps, Head goes on the back foot to punch it back"
228,"Siraj to Labuschagne, no run, slower ball off-cutter full outside off, turned to Kohli at mid-wicket who shies and shows that he is there, wide of the stumps and Rahul collects"

232,"Matty Hayden on air: The 13th man here is 1,30,000."
233,"Siraj to Head, FOUR, these boundaries are going to hurt India. Round the wicket and dug in short on the stumps, Head was waiting for it, hammered over mid-wicket and the pull runs away"
234,"Siraj to Labuschagne, 1 run, short of length outside off, Labuschagne angles it to the left of backward point for an easy single"
235,"Siraj to Labuschagne, no run, fullish and shaping back in towards off, Labuschagne gets forward to show the full face to drive to mid-off"
238,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, 1 run, on the pads, Labuschagne closes the bat face towards deep mid-wicket"
239,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, 2 runs, flat on off, Labuschagne rocks back to cut to the right of sweeper cover. Solid commitment from Shreyas Iyer who covered about 20 yards in a matter of seconds and dived to stop the boundary. Just two runs"
240,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, no run, top delivery!! On a length and going across the batter, Labuschagne didn't read it at all!! Beaten on the outside edge"
241,Kuldeep is keeping it much shorter to Travis Head. He's been a bit ruffled by that six
242,Ishan Kishan on the field (at long-off) for someone
243,"Kuldeep Yadav to Head, 1 run, length ball on off, cut towards sweeper cover."
244,"Kuldeep Yadav to Head, no run, flat and skids through outside off. Late cut towards backward point"
245,"Nasser Hussain about Travis Head: Good thing about Travis Head is he is not just going into his bunker and thinking I will just knock it around. He is still being positive, you can tell from his body language, his intent, if there is a bad ball he will put you away. He picked up Kuldeep perfectly, slogsweep for six, and five fours already."
246,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, 1 run, flighted up and wider, Labuschagne leans closer to drive past covers and towards wide long-off"
248,"Siraj to Labuschagne, 1 run, fuller and skiddy, keeps a tad low on off stump. Labuschagne opens the bat face late on his block to scamper a single to the left of Jadeja at backward point"
249,"Siraj to Head, 1 run, back of length on the body, pulled into the ground towards deep mid-wicket"
250,"Siraj to Labuschagne, 1 run, fraction short angling onto off. Labuschagne with a very gentle push towards covers to sneak the single. 50 partnership up for this duo"
251,"Siraj to Labuschagne, no run, good length and straight, Labuschagne with a slight inward shimmy plays the forward defence"
252,"Nasser Hussain on air: It is always slightly easier in a run chase, you know the target, the required rate is only 4.55. You don't have to panic. Only way they can win this is get wickets, India."
253,"Siraj to Head, 1 run, length ball just outside off, slapped towards the left of sweeper cover"
254,"Siraj to Head, no run, good length angling inwards from round the wicket. Head makes room but controls his aggressive instinct to push the ball towards mid-off"
256,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, no run, tossed up on leg stump, defended"
257,Now India have 3 fielders inside the ring on the leg-side for Marnus against Kuldeep. And immediately a single is saved.

259,"Kuldeep Yadav to Head, no run, on the boots, turned to mid-wicket"
260,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, 1 run, tossed up on the pads, turned between square leg and mid-wicket for a single"

262,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, no run, on the pads, tickled towards short fine"
263,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, no run, pitched fuller on off, blocked to the left of Kuldeep"
264,Some ropes and blankets being used to wipe off the grass. So does that mean dew is on the horizon?
265,"Drinks are on the field now. Post the powerplay, Australia have got things under some sort of control. Marnus and Travis Head are looking comfortable. The bad news for India is the pitch isn't turning as much as expected, and these batters haven't been troubled much at all. India need a wicket out of somewhere or this duo can take the game at their pace. Dew is always a concern in the evenings here in Ahmedabad."
267,"Siraj to Labuschagne, 1 run, back of length angling onto the ribs, tickled towards fine leg"
268,"Siraj to Head, 1 run, Siraj attacks Head with a short ball, pulled towards deep square leg"
269,"Siraj to Head, FOUR, back of length on off, Head stays leg side, makes room and then opens the bat face late to squeeze the ball out behind square on the off side for a boundary"
270,"Ian Bishop: That is a top stop by Virat Kohli (16.1), that was travelling."
271,"Ricky Ponting: One of the hardest balls I have seen hit in this World Cup. Beautiful pick up on the half-volley. Surprised Travis, I think he thought it was through and past him (Kohli)."
272,"Siraj to Head, no run, back of length, slower and gets that spongy bounce outside off, reaches KL after pitching twice as Head lets the ball pass"
273,"Siraj to Head, no run, length ball wobbling just outside off, pushed towards backward point"
274,ICYMI: Shami is back on the field.
275,"Siraj to Head, no run, full and offers some room. Driven really hard but stopped by Kohli at covers. That was travelling like a tracer bullet but Kohli absorbed the blow"
276,"Mohammed Siraj, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack"
277,"After 16 overs, time for Siraj. Just in case anybody had forgotten, he's also playing and now it is time for him to play his part!!"
278,"Australia's innings is mimicking that of India's quite closely, three wickets lost quite early followed by a rebuilding phase where the batters try and hunker down which consequently leads to a dip in the scoring rate."
280,"Kuldeep Yadav to Head, 1 run, pitched fuller, driven out towards long-off"
281,"Kuldeep Yadav to Head, SIX, eerie silence.... Pitched up on middle, was right in the slot for Travis Head to clear that front leg and heave it over deep mid-wicket into the stands. Was in full control and got a clean connection on that"
282,"Kuldeep Yadav to Head, no run, pushed through on off and Head drives but Kohli stops it like a salmon at covers. Very sharp stuff from the former Indian skipper"
283,14.6 an example of the difference in fielding between Australia and India. So many singles were cut off by the Aussies as the mid-wicket fielder cut off the angle and stopped those pushes and tucks. India so far haven't been able to do the same.
284,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, 1 run, spinning onto the pads, Labuschagne shuffled to clip behind square for a single"
285,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, no run, in the air...... a big turner that spins down leg after pitching. Labuschagne shuffled inwards and wasn't in control of the clip. Lobs it up but short of Gill at square leg"
286,"Kuldeep Yadav to Head, 1 run, flat delivery on off, cut towards sweeper cover. Easy runs here"
287,"The mood has turned quiet once again in Ahmedabad. The crowd senses that a partnership is blooming once again, and the spinners haven't looked very threatening yet"

295,"Jadeja to Labuschagne, 1 run, flat outside off, Labuschagne gets closer to push it towards sweeper cover"
296,Why not 3 fielders inside the ring on the leg-side for Marnus when Kuldeep is bowling? 3 on the off-side seems one too many with Kuldeep not bowling the googly that often to the right-hander. This field is helping Marnus to knock to the unmanned backward square leg region and pick easy singles.
298,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, 1 run, leg spinner that ends outside off. Labuschagne pushes it towards point for a single."
299,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, no run, with the arm outside off from a length. Pushed towards backward point"
300,"Kuldeep Yadav to Head, 1 run, tossed fuller, Head gets right to the pitch and drives towards long-off"

303,"Kuldeep Yadav to Head, 1 run, on a length and spinning away, punched towards sweeper cover"
304,A lot hinges on Marnus for Australia. He's the one capable of anchoring on a tricky wicket and really making life tough for the opposition. And batting is only going to get tougher on this pitch...
306,"Jadeja to Labuschagne, no run, pitched fuller and quicker at the stumps, Labuschagne defends"
307,"Jadeja to Head, 1 run, flat on middle stump, punched towards long-off"
308,"Jadeja to Labuschagne, 1 run, a tad shorter and with the arm towards leg, turned to the right of mid-wicket to rotate strike"

315,"Kuldeep Yadav to Head, 1 run, flat delivery just outside off, punched towards deep point"
316,More heads-up captaincy from Rohit here. He wants to bowl his spinners before the potential dew settles in.
317,"Kuldeep Yadav to Head, no run, flat and goes on without any spin towards middle. Head rocks back and pulls but towards mid-wicket where Rohit makes a smart stop"
318,A slip in place now
319,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, 1 run, pushed through a bit quicker and fuller, driven towards long-on"
320,"Kuldeep Yadav to Labuschagne, no run, tossed up and was looking for that sharp turn back in that has troubled so many batters in the past. Labuschagne with a full blooded forward defence on that one"

322,"Kuldeep Yadav, comes into the attack"
323,Now over to Kuldeep.
324,After 10.5 Illingworth just asked Jadeja to calm down. Not too happy with the excitement shown.
326,"Jadeja to Head, no run, close call again, no review taken. The Indians ran out of time. On a length and spins back in sharply after pitching on middle to have Head playing the wrong line. Caught on the pad but maybe the ball was doing too much. Ball-tracking shows it to be missing leg"
327,"Jadeja to Head, 2 runs, a loud appeal for LBW but 'bat' murmurs KL as he has a discussion with Jadeja. This was a flat delivery that went on with the arm, very close to the front pad but Head inside-edges his cut towards fine leg. Two runs taken"
328,Shami as soon as he finished his 5th over signalled to the Indian camp that he wants to come in. More of a comfort break and some rest one feels.
329,"Jadeja to Head, no run, flat delivery, stump lined. Pushed back towards Jadeja"
330,"Jadeja to Labuschagne, 1 run, strays onto the pads, clipped towards deep square leg"
331,"Bharat Sundaresan: ""Perhaps the Jasprit Bumrah delivery was so good, and it was, that even Steve Smith decided it deserved a wicket & didn’t review. Bizarre to see him not go for a DRS and that too in a World Cup final."""
332,"Jadeja to Labuschagne, no run, darted through on middle, spinning away. Blocked leg side"
333,"Jadeja to Labuschagne, no run, pitched fuller on off, Labuschagne with a forward defence"
334,"Jadeja to Head, 2 wides, spin straightaway but turns down the leg side after pitching on a length. Not a clean gather by Rahul and the Aussies scamper for an extra"
336,"Ravindra Jadeja, Left arm orthodox, comes into the attack"
338,Powerplay over and the game is in the balance. India also got a flier and then they were slowed down as the pitch slowed down. Will Australia face something similar?
340,"Shami to Labuschagne, no run, short of length delivery, Marnus defends off the back foot"
341,"Shami to Head, 1 run, oh tries to maximize the powerplay and goes for a big shot through point, gets an inside edge that rolls past the stumps to square leg"
342,"Shami to Head, FOUR, and Head is off again after being kept calm. Shami went for a slower delivery like his partner but it's landed in the slot and Head manages to drill it past the non-striker for four"
343,Rohit gestured to KL with a frown on his face not to get up too early after those 4 byes. Meanwhile Kohli asks the crowd to ramp it up. As if they are not doing it already.
344,"Shami to Head, FOUR, this is outstanding from Head! He tried to guide the ball in the gap previous ball since third man is inside, now succeeds as he plays the ball close to the body and very late. This time goes to the right of short third man. Clever batting"

346,"Shami to Head, no run, good length delivery angling in, Head looks to flick, ball hits the pad as he misses. Easily missing leg though"

349,"Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run, Marnus defends from the crease and he literally presses the ball into the wicket as it bounces again off the bat"
350,Meanwhile Virat cheers the crowd to get behind the bowler
352,"Bumrah to Labuschagne, byes, FOUR, oh dear! What have you done KL? What should have been a dot ball is now four byes and Rohit isn't happy. KL has been outstanding with the gloves all tournament but seems a little off colour today"
353,"Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run, short of length delivery, Marnus defends off the back foot"
354,"Shane Watson on air: ""My heart has broken after seeing that."" This after the impact was outside off for that Smith LBW."

357,"Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run, defended off the back foot"
358,"Bumrah to Labuschagne, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Marnus defends off the back foot"
359,"That slower ball off-cutter again! Remember Shaun Marsh in a Test. Mohammad Rizwan in this World Cup. It's that special ball again. Massive moment in the game and the crowd are losing it already in Ahmedabad. Smith did not want to waste a review and walked off. And guess what, the impact was outside off stump. How costly would this prove for Australia?"

365,"Shami to Head, no run, short of length delivery angling in, Head swipes across the line and misses. Crowd appeal for catch. That cut Head in half and KL dived to his right to catch"
366,"A yorker to Head might do it, he is backing away and exposing his stumps against Bumrah. Staying very leg-side of the ball. So far it has been good length/back of a length to him."
367,"Shami to Head, no run, back of length delivery angling in, cut towards backward point. Marnus wanted to run but was sent back"
368,"Marnus Labuschagne, right handed bat, comes to the crease"
370,"Bumrah to Smith, out Lbw!! Oh well, well! Jasprit Bumrah you master. He completely foxed Smith here with a slower delivery. This is as good as the Shaun Marsh slower ball at the MCG or the Rizwan slower delivery here in Ahmedabad. India outsmarting the Aussie batters by moving fields. Virat was asked to go to short mid-wicket from slip before this ball. So Smith in his mind could have thought I can't play leg-side now so let me play straight. And Bumrah so smartly slipped in an off-cutting slower delivery, Smith missed it and the finger went up. Interesting Smith didn't review that. He did have a chat with Head but walked off. Height was a question surely. Oh hang on, the replay says impact outside off stump. What a moment in the game. Why didn't you review that Smudgy? Smith lbw b Bumrah 4(9) [4s-1]"
371,"Bumrah to Smith, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!"
372,Slip goes to short mid-wicket
373,"Bumrah to Smith, no run, back to back of a length, Smith defends to the on-side"
374,"Bumrah to Smith, FOUR, neat, Steve Smith high backlift trademark on-drive! Kuldeep throws himself to the left at mid-on but the ball escapes. Length delivery on the stumps, Smith covered the line and middled that decently well"

376,"Bumrah to Head, 1 run, opens the bat face and taps it to point, do you want that single, Smudge is the question and Smith runs"
377,"Bumrah to Head, no run, fullish delivery outside off stump, Head drives, but the man at short cover dives to his left and took some pace off to deflect it to mid-off. Did well to cut the angle"
379,"Shami to Smith, no run, oh this keeps a tad low and Smith just manages to get his bat down in time to save LBW/bowled!"
380,"Shami to Smith, no run, good length delivery just outside off stump, Smith defends off the back foot"
381,"The crowd are getting behind the Indian bowlers for every delivery here. Barring the few moments of silence when Australia hit a boundary, it's been raucous out there."
382,"Shami to Head, 1 run, short of length delivery on the stumps, Head pushes it to mid-on, lovely diving save to the right from Siraj"
383,"Shami to Head, no run, oh very tentative in his defence is Travis Head now to Shami as the bowler targets the stumps. He's opening up the batter. If it moves away, the edge could be in play"
384,"Shami to Head, no run, short of length delivery on the off stump, Head defends"
385,"Shami to Head, no run, appeal for LBW. Umpire Richard Kettleborough says no. Could be missing leg and that's exactly what KL was suggesting. Short of a length delivery angled in, Head looks to hop and defend, escapes because it wasn't straight enough. Head might have hit that too, yes!"
386,STAT: 17th dismissal behind the wicket for KL Rahul - the most by an Indian wicketkeeper in a World Cup surpassing 16 by his coach Rahul Dravid in the 2003 edition.
387,The atmosphere is absolutely buzzing in Ahmedabad. Head is now the key player for Australia in the powerplay as they will look to him to get some boundaries going against the hard new ball.
388,"Good observation by DK on air: Shami with a semi-new ball bowling first-change when the ball swings less is more potent as he is basically a seam bowler who gets swing. Has more control then. Now he is trying too hard to get wickets and that's why he has not looked as threatening as he has been, despite the wicket."

393,"Steven Smith, right handed bat, comes to the crease"
394,"Bumrah to Mitchell Marsh, out Caught by Rahul!! It was Marsh caught at slip off Bumrah at Chepauk. It is Marsh caught KL off Bumrah in Ahmedabad. Now you almost figure out why Rohit sent Siraj to long-off to offer that single to Marsh last ball of the previous over. Marsh got out to Naveen who also bowls from a wide angle and Bumrah is a master at that art. Short of a length delivery outside off stump, Marsh goes for the cut, under edge and it carries to KL, who pouches it clean. Two down now. Mitchell Marsh c Rahul b Bumrah 15(15) [4s-1 6s-1]"

400,"Shami to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, long-off back for this ball and Marsh drives for a single. Wonder if that is to let Marsh have a single to face Bumrah. Rohit asked Siraj to go to long-off after a chat with Shami"

402,"KL Rahul has been very impressive throughout the tournament but he looks a touch fidgety today, he's let a couple (of relatively difficult ones) go through down leg and hasn't gathered a few cleanly. There's also a lot of swing after the ball has gone past the batter though."
403,"Shami to Mitchell Marsh, 2 runs, short of length delivery on the stumps, Marsh glances through backward square leg"
404,"Shami to Mitchell Marsh, SIX, that is the big statement from Marsh! Anything in his slot and he's get under and smack it without bothering to keep it down. That had a lot of hang time as it cleared long-off"
405,After 3.1 (the wide ball) Shami shook his head and stared at the landing area. Is he not happy with where his foot is landing?
406,"Shami to Mitchell Marsh, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Marsh lets it go. Ball wobbles to trouble KL as he tries to collect"
407,"Shami to Mitchell Marsh, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Marsh looks to push it towards cover, inside-edges towards mid-on"
408,"Shami to Mitchell Marsh, 3 wides, another swinging delivery finishing down leg, lucky KL got a hand on it. Virat runs from slip to stop the boundary"
409,STAT: The 15-run over from Bumrah was his most expensive in WC 2023 and the first time he has conceded 10+ runs in an over inside Powerplay 1.
410,Will be interesting to see Siraj at first-change. He has not done that in this tournament and quite a while since he has not taken the new-ball in ODIs. And it's a big game. How will his nerves be?
412,"Bumrah to Head, no run, beaten! Head is having serious trouble facing the away-moving ball from round the wicket as Bumrah is getting sharp nip away from the pitch too. Totally opened up in defence, so lucky not to have kissed this to KL"
413,"Bumrah to Head, no run, length delivery, Head mistimes towards mid-off"
414,"Bumrah to Head, no run, unplayable. Short of a length delivery angling in around off stump and moving away cunningly to square up Head in his back foot defence, so close to taking the edge as it flew past the bat"
415,"Bumrah to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, pushes this to cover-point and gets off strike"
416,"Couple of balls now that haven't quite carried through to Rahul, should he and Kohli at slip take a step forward?"
417,"Bumrah to Mitchell Marsh, no run, swinging away, Marsh plays and misses again"
418,"Bumrah to Mitchell Marsh, no run, short of length delivery swinging away, Marsh swings and misses"
420,"Shami to Head, no run, good length delivery just outside off stump, Head defends from the crease"
421,"Shami to Mitchell Marsh, leg byes, 1 run, nip-backer but finishes down leg, Marsh misses the glance"
422,Now deep point in place
423,"Shami to Mitchell Marsh, FOUR, there's the conterattack from Marsh. Attack his best form of defence. Short of a length delivery, Marsh smacks it hard over the infield and over cover-point. No fielder there"
424,"Shami to Mitchell Marsh, 5 wides, oh swinging too far down leg and even a hand from a diving KL isn't good enough. Inswinger gone wrong and Rohit isn't happy"
425,"Shami to Head, byes, 1 run, look at that ball wobble after it passes the batter but they get a bye"
426,"Shami to Mitchell Marsh, 1 run, ohh inside edge as Marsh looks to swing hard and this inswinger troubles him, the thick inside-edge rolls away to deep backward square leg"
427,"Mitchell Marsh, right handed bat, comes to the crease"
428,"Shami to Warner, out Caught by Kohli!! Mo Shami you beauty! India made the bold call to get Shami on early than first change and it's worked. One of the big fishes is in the net. You always expect Shami to trouble left-handers with his form in this World Cup. Stuart Broad owned Warner in Tests from round the wicket and the world took notice. Shami loves bowling under lights and Ahmedabad is his den in the IPL and he loves bowling to left-handers, he strikes almost straightaway. Good length delivery angling in, moved away late, Warner reached out for a cut, kind of toe-ended it to Virat who is the lone slip fielder. Ahmedabad finds its voice again! Warner c Kohli b Shami 7(3) [4s-1]"
429,"Shami to Warner, THATS OUT!! Caught!!"
430,"Shami to Warner, wide, stays round the wicket and fires down leg, Warner looks to glance and misses. India try to trick the ump with an appeal but the wide is called"
431,STAT: Zaheer Khan conceded 15 runs off the opening over in 2003 finals.
432,"Mohammed Shami, right-arm fast medium, comes into the attack"
433,Oh interesting! It's Shami taking the new ball and not Siraj
434,This is just the start Australia wanted
436,"Bumrah to Head, FOUR, Bumrah looks to bowl the inswinger and fires it full outside off stump, didn't swing, just went straight. Head says ah thank you very much and drives wide of mid-off to the right"
437,"HUGE MOMENT IN THE GAME? A thick outside edge first ball and the slip cordon (Kohli and Gill) left it to each other. The ball flew away to the third man fence ultimately and it was TK Dilip, the Indian fielding coach, who collected the ball near the circumference before tossing it back onto the field. Just before India got onto the field, Dilip was seen having a chat with a few players after the conclusion of fielding drills. Bumrah was absolutely shell-shocked and did display his disgust before wearing a wry smile. Rohit Sharma too looked very disappointed and shut his eyes momentarily. Dinesh Karthik, on comms, felt that it was more of Kohli's catch (1st slip) than Gill's (2nd slip)."
438,"Bumrah to Head, no run, short of length delivery finishin just outside off stump, Head defends"
439,"Bumrah to Head, FOUR, again big outswing but with a lot of width, Head drives in the big gap between mid-off and cover and Head is away too"
440,"The stadium is engulfed in loud chants, they've found their voice again and India will need them to keep willing them on throughout"
441,"Bumrah to Head, no run, full and swinging away outside off stump, Head lets it go"
442,Round the wicket to Head
443,"Bumrah to Warner, 3 runs, nice outswing again but it's in the slot, Warner leans forward to push it through cover-point, does beat the dive, Jadeja hunts it down"
444,Bumrah round the wicket to Head and two slips for him. Third man and fine-leg back.
445,"Bumrah to Warner, FOUR, edgedddd and no-one goes for it! Swinging away outside off stump, Warner feels for the ball and plays away from the body, thick outside edge. Virat at slip thought Gill would dive to the right from second slip and Gill thought VIrat would go to the left. It was definitely closer to Virat"
446,Warner and Head are at the crease. Warner is on strike. Bumrah will open the attack
